## What This Plugin Does

**Gandalf** is the AI assistant for Haanpaa Martial Arts staff. Built as a WordPress admin chat interface on WordPress 7.0's WP AI Client (`wp_ai_client_prompt()`). Four agent personas (Sales, Coaching, Finance, Admin) with role-based access control. Staff interact with "Gandalf" — the technical plugin slug `hma-ai-chat` is internal only.

**Two-layer architecture** (see `docs/architecture/ai-architecture-paperclip.md`):
- **Layer 1 (this plugin)**: Interactive chat — staff selects an agent, sends messages, gets AI responses
- **Layer 2 (Paperclip)**: Autonomous scheduling — agents wake on schedules, execute tasks, request approval via webhook

### Database Tables
- `wp_hma_ai_conversations` — user_id, agent, title, timestamps
- `wp_hma_ai_messages` — conversation_id (FK), role, content, tokens_used
- `wp_hma_ai_pending_actions` — agent, action_type, action_data (JSON), status, run_id

### Extension Points
- `hma_ai_chat_agents_registered` — add custom agents to the registry
- `hma_ai_chat_action_approved` — fires when an action is approved
- `hma_ai_chat_action_rejected` — fires when an action is rejected
- `hma_ai_chat_execution_complete` — fires when Paperclip run completes
- `hma_ai_chat_mcp_public_ability` — return `false` to suppress a tool from MCP clients via the [WordPress/mcp-adapter](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter) integration. Default exposes every Gandalf tool; write tools still queue for staff approval through the existing PendingAction flow.

### MCP Integration

Gandalf abilities are tagged with `meta['mcp']['public'] = true` so the [`mcp-adapter`](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter) plugin (when installed alongside this one) exposes them to external MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT desktop). All tools route through the same `ToolExecutor` pipeline whether invoked from the in-plugin chat or via MCP — capability gates and write-tool approval are enforced identically. See [docs/mcp-adapter-spike.md](docs/mcp-adapter-spike.md) for the operator runbook.

### Agent Personas
| Slug | Display name | Capability | Icon |
|------|--------------|-----------|------|
| `sales` | Sales | `edit_posts` | 💼 |
| `coaching` | Coaching | `edit_posts` | 🥋 |
| `finance` | Pippin | `manage_options` | 🍎 |
| `admin` | Gandalf (Admin Agent) | `manage_options` | ⚙️ |

The `finance` and `admin` personas share the full `ADMIN_TOOLS` set — they're differentiated by system prompt only. Pippin and Gandalf reference each other in their prompts (Pippin defers staffing/policy questions to Gandalf; Gandalf trusts Pippin's tool-grounded numbers).

## Current Status
